#Tuesday, September 22nd: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
* Why do you want to separate style?
* One CSS _rule_ is made up of _selectors_ and _declarations_. A declaration is a _property-value_ pair.
  - You really want to refer to a CSS cheat sheet!
* Three types of selectors: HTML tag names, ID, class
  - ID: should only be used once; starts with "#"
  - class: can be used many times; start with "."
  - Mixing IDs and classes is confusing, generally not a good idea.
  - "id" and "class" attribute exist for all HTML elements
  - Generic block HTML element: div
  - Generic inline HTML element: span
* Box model for HTML body elements
* The "cascading" in "cascading style sheet"
  - What if there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?
* Loading additional stylesheets
