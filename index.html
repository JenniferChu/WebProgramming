		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><a href="http://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew for Mac OS X</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Assessment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Programming assignments and labs (45%)</li>
<li>Quizzes (30%; there will be three in the class)</li>
<li>Semester group project (15%)</li>
<li>Participation in classroom activities (10%)</li>
</ul>

<p>Class participation encompasses a variety of activities, all with the same purpose.  To earn high grades for class participation, you must show that you are actively engaged in managing your own learning, developing new skills, and developing new ways of programming and problem-solving. You can be engaged in a variety of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing sane and sensible answers on quizzes</li>
<li>Asking appropriate questions in class</li>
<li>Answering questions when called on in class</li>
<li>Asking appropriate questions on Piazza</li>
<li>Answering questions well on Piazza</li>
<li>Organizing study groups</li>
<li>Interacting professionally with programming partners and course staff</li>
<li>Working out ideas with teaching assistants</li>
<li>Helping other COMP 20 students in Halligan</li>
</ul>

<p>Nobody has to do all of these things; you can earn top grades for class participation by doing just a few things well. In particular, nobody is required to speak in class, but everybody should be prepared to answer questions if called upon.</p>

<p>Professional interactions with other students and with course staff are the same as those which are expected in any workplace. It is also professional for you to recognize that a member of the course staff may be present but not actually available to talk about COMP 20.</p>

<h2 id="policy">Course Policies</h2>

<h3>Assignment Late Policy</h3>
<p>Assignments (labs, homework) are due at 11:59 PM, generally on a Tuesday or Thursday. We will grant an automatic extension of ten minutes at no cost to you.</p>
<p>An assignment is expected to be submitted on time. However, we recognize that the exigencies of college life occasionally interfere with on-time submission. If you have difficulty getting the assignment in on time, you have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>For ordinary difficulties, each student is automatically issued three (3) "extension tokens." By expending an extension token, you can get an automatic 24-hour extension on all deadlines associated with a single assignment.  To use an extension token, you must e-mail me at <code>mchow@cs.tufts.edu</code>. Thus must be sent before the assignment is due.  At most two extension tokens may be expended on any single assignment.  When you are out of tokens, late assignments will no longer be accepted: it will be returned ungraded, and you will receive no credit for the work.</li>
<li>If a serious illness affects your ability to complete the assignment on time, your first step is to report the illness using the "Illness Notification Form" that is available in WebCenter for Students. We will make suitable arrangements. For extraordinary difficulties, such as bereavement, family emergencies, or other extraordinary unpleasant events, your first step should be to make contact with your associate dean for undergraduate education. You must take this step before the assignment is due. Ask your dean to drop me an email or give me a call, and we will make special arrangements that are suited to your circumstances.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please understand that extension tokens are meant to be used.  That is, you will not receive any special bonus at the end of the course if you do not use any of your extension tokens.</p>

<h3>Labs</h3>
<p>A lab is due one week from the day it is assigned.</p>

<h3>Solutions to Assignments and Examinations</h3>
<p>Solutions to assignments and examinations will not be posted for this course.</p>
