<h2>Fall 2014 Semester Group Project</h2>
</div>

<section id="main-content">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>You will be working on a team of 4 or 5 people (see below) to create a prototype pertaining to <span class="def">personal health and fitness</span>.  Please note that a prototype is different than a product: a product is a complete system with documentation while a prototype simulates most of the complete system.  I do not expect a full-blown product to be completed by the end of the semester.</p>

<h2>Goal of Semester Group Project</h2>
<p class="stress">Have students work in a team to define a problem, build and demo a solution.</p>

<h2>Past Semester Group Project Themes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spring 2014: Personal Finance</li>
<li>Spring 2013: Vehicles</li>
<li>Spring 2011: Retail</li>
<li>Fall 2010: Personal Finance</li>
</ul>

<!--<h2>Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>TBD</li>
</ul>-->

<h2>Unacceptable Project Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>A blog</li>
<li>A message board</li>
</ul>

<h2>Security and Privacy of Data</h2>
<p>Because you will be potentially working with health information, you need to carefully consider the security and privacy of using and collecting health and personal data. Please read:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.privacyrights.org/mobile-health-and-fitness-apps-what-are-privacy-risks" target="_blank">Mobile Health and Fitness Apps:
What Are the Privacy Risks? (privacyrights.org)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/09/09/as-apple-moves-into-health-apps-what-happens-to-privacy/" target="_blank">As Apple Moves into Health Apps, What Happens to Privacy? (WSJ)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/15/us-usa-healthcare-tech-idUSKBN0HA2AK20140915" target="_blank">
App developers seek clearer U.S. health data privacy guidelines (Reuters)</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Absolute Requirements</h2>
<p>Your team's project must adhere to the following non-negotiable requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Must use HTML5.</li>
<li>Must use JavaScript, jQuery, and Ajax.</li>
<li>The team must use <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for the project.  Each team will be provided a private repo in GitHub under the <code>tuftsdev</code> organization.</li>
<li>Must have desktop and mobile web user interfaces.  That is, the user interface is different on the desktop than on mobile.</li>
<li>Must use a server-side framework or technology (e.g., Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails)</li>
<li>Must use least 2 web / RESTful APIs (e.g., RunKeeper, MyFitnessPal, Google Fit) with JSON and/or XML parsing</li>
</ol>

<h2>Pick Five</h2>
<p>On top of the absolute requirements, the project must use at least 5 of the following technologies or ideas (your team's choice):</p>
<ul>
<li>Geolocation</li>
<li>Server-side data persistence (e.g., with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL)</li>
<li>Client-side data persistence with either local storage or web SQL</li>
<li>Front-end framework including Bootstrap, React, Backbone.js, AngularJS</li>
<li>Data or screen scraping</li>
<li>Reporting with charts and graphs</li>
<li>Send emails, SMSes, or push notifications</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<ol>
<li><span class="def">Project proposal and design doc (15 points; <span class="note">due on Thursday, October 16th</span>)</span>.  <span class="stress">In text format and using bullet-points:</span>
<ul>
<li>Project title</li>
<li>Problem statement (i.e., what is the problem?)</li>
<li>How do you solve the problem?</li>
<li>List of all the features that your team <span class="stress">will</span> implement (including which of the "Pick 5" items were chosen by the team). Your team will be held accountable for the features you list!</li>
<li>What data will your prototype be using and collecting</li>
<li>Any algorithms or special techniques that will be necessary</li>
<li>Electronic mockups of what your team will be developing using <span class="stress">wireframes</span>.  No hand-drawn mockups accepted.  Tools to create wireframes include <a href="https://balsamiq.com/" target="_blank">Balsamiq (commercial; de facto standard)</a>, <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/" target="_blank">Gliffy</a>, <a href="http://www.mockflow.com/" target="_blank">MockFlow</a>, and even Microsoft PowerPoint.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="def">Project checkup (10 points; <span class="note">due on Thursday, October 30th</span>)</span> - I will be looking for evidence in your team's private GitHub repository that your team started working on the project.  It does not have to be elaborate.</li>
<li><span class="def">Status report 1 (5 points; <span class="note">due on Friday, November 7th</span>)</span> - This file must be in your team's private GitHub repository, written in either text or Markdown format, that outlines (1) what was accomplished during the week, (2) challenges and issues team faced during the week, and (3) your goals for the next week.</li>
<li><span class="def">Status report 2 (5 points; <span class="note">due on Friday, November 14th</span>)</span> - Please do not overwrite your status report from the week before.</li>
<li><span class="def">Status report 3 (5 points; <span class="note">due on Friday, November 21st</span>)</span> - Ditto.</li>

<li><span class="def">The completed project (40 points; <span class="note">ABSOLUTE DEADLINE on Wednesday, December 10th at 12 PM</span>)</span></li>
<li><span class="def">Elevator pitch presentation (10 points; <span class="note">on Wednesday, December 10th at 12 PM</span>)</span> - You have less than 5 minutes to explain your project to me and to the judges!  Room and location TBD.</li>
</ol>

<p>The remaining 10 points of the project (out of 100 total points) will be for individual performance on the team based on your teammates' feedback.  That is, underperforming members of a team can receive a lower grade for the final project.</p>

<h2>Example Project Proposal</h2>
<p>Here is <a href="https://github.com/TylerLubeck/comp20-team3">one from spring 2013</a> (Tyler Lubeck's team).</p>

<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>All works and ideas are owned by the members of the team.  I cannot take ownership of any of your work.  I do not have stake or equity in any project created in my classes for that matter.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>I can add to the list of "Pick 5" or "Ideas" at any time.</li>
<li>Your team is allowed to change direction or scope of the project but your team will need to submit a new project proposal / design doc and no time extension will be given.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>Your team will be graded on five factors:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="stress">Functionality</span> - Something that works consistently. Remember, a project with fewer features that work is significantly better than one with numerous features, in which some either do not work or are buggy.</li>
<li><span class="stress">Utility</span> - Does your project fulfill a recognized need?  Is it also easy to understand?</li>
<li><span class="stress">Originality</span> - C'mon, another running app or calorie counter?  Better if your team strives to do something more cosmic.</li>
<li><span class="stress">Technical Competency</span> - Use <a href="http://kotaku.com/5975610/the-exceptional-beauty-of-doom-3s-source-code" target="_blank">good programming practices</a>, consistent Git commits and pushes, meaningful Git commit messages used.  Egregious data collecting will be penalized.</li>
<li><span class="stress">Teamwork</span> - Does all team members contribute?  Having one or two people doing all the work is not good.  <span class="note">On the last day of class, Thursday, December 4th, every person will conduct a performance review on each teammate!</span></li>
</ol>
