<h2><span class="note">ABSOLUTELY NO SUBMISSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED AFTER SUNDAY, April 27th!</span></h2>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Perform a security assessment on a potentially vulnerable web application.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>So you completed the 2048 Game Center application (<a href="a4.html">Assignment 4</a>).  Unfortunately, it is riddled with security vulnerabilities.  Assume that you have been hired as a security consultant to document and resolve the security issues in the application.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>You will be assigned an Assignment 4 deliverable by another student in the class to penetration test and analyze (see below).  You are also free to collaborate with the student on all matters.  Your goal is to break the application --that is, find as many security problems as you can.  You <span class="stress">must find at least three (3) vulnerabilities in the other students' product.</span>  You are also allowed to use security tools such as <a href="http://www.portswigger.net/burp/download.html" target="_blank">Burp Suite</a>, <a href="http://mitmproxy.org/" target="_blank">mitmproxy</a>, curl, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tamper-data/" target="_blank">Tamper Data</a>.</p>

<p><span class="stress">It is not necessary for you to use any of the security tools listed above but a good idea nonetheless.</span>  The only deliverable for this portion of the assignment is a security assessment document in HTML5 format in your private GitHub repository: <code>security/index.html</code> in the <code>gh-pages</code> and <code>master</code> branches.  Your document must have the following sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="stress">Introduction</span> - Provide a description of the product and what you were hired to do</li>
<li><span class="stress">Methodology</span> - Describe your methodology pen testing the application, including the tools that you used</li>
<li><span class="stress">Abstract of Findings</span> - Provide an overview of all the security issues you identified.  This section should be written for non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have time to read the entire document.  Write this section using lay language.</li>
<li><span class="stress">Issues Found</span> - For each issue that you find, document:
<ul>
<li>Issue (e.g., database injection, really bad programming practice)</li>
<li>Location / page where issue was found</li>
<li>Severity of issue (e.g., low, medium , or high).  Justify your answer.</li>
<li>Description of issue.  How did you find it?  A screenshot of problem is excellent.</li>
<li>Proof of vulnerability.  Screenshots are ideal.</li>
<li>Resolution.  How did you resolve the issue? <span class="stress">Show code if possible</span>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span class="stress">Conclusion</span> - You can also list future considerations and recommendations with costs.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The <code>README</code> File</h2>
<p>Include a <code>README</code> file that describes the work. This description must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.</li>
<li>Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.</li>
<li>Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.</li>
<li>Be written in either text format (thus <code>README.txt</code>) or in Markdown (thus <code>README.md</code>). No other formats will be accepted.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>I will be assessing your document based on its breadth and depth:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(1 point)</strong> - Introduction</li>
<li><strong>(1 point)</strong> - Methodology</li>
<li><strong>(2 points)</strong> - Abstract of findings</li>
<li><strong>(3 points)</strong> - Issues found and technical analysis of issues found</li>
<li><strong>(1 point)</strong> - Conclusion</li>
<li><strong>(1 point)</strong> - Grammar, spelling, style (e.g., must be in HTML format)</li>
<li><strong>(1 point)</strong> - <code>README</code> document exists; report is named <code>index.html</code> in folder named <code>security</code> in private GitHub repo in <code>gh-pages</code> and <code>master</code> branches</li>
</ul>

<h2>Submitting the Assignment</h2>
<p>Push all your changes to the private repository that I created for you in a folder named <code>security</code> to both your <code>gh-pages</code> and <code>master</code> branches.  Say that your private repository is named <code>comp20-mchow</code>, make sure all the files are pushed to <code>comp20-mchow/security</code>.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can identify multiple instances of a security issue in your document.  Example: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on two different sections of the web application.</li>
<li>It is important that you <span class="stress">read</span> your partner's source code!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p class="directions">Q: Is this an individual assignment or a team assignment?</p>
<p>A: An individual assignment.  You are free to collaborate with your partner but each student will submit his/her own report.</p>

<p class="directions">Q: Are we supposed to read the downloaded source code in order to make our attacks on the site we are attacking?  Or should we try to do it without going through the source code?  I'm not sure how to tell my attacks are working.</p>
<p>A: Two step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, perform attacks WITHOUT reading the source code!  This is also known as "black box" testing.</li>
<li>Then, download or get from your partner, the source code of the application.  Peruse through it, perform a manual code review of it, and document for your findings.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find anything glaring, then go back to the application and attack it.  This is also known as "white box" testing.  For example, after you read the source code for the search function and you are suspicious that you can perform a SQL injection attack to delete a table (also given the database structure from your partner), go ahead an try it out :-)</p>

<p class="directions">Q: Is it necessary to use all the programs listed above? I'm having trouble running Burp Suite specifically. I was able to get a good amount of information from Paros and from looking at the source code, though.</p>
<p>A: No.</p>

<p class="directions">Q: I'm using a tool and it gave me back a URL under alerts.  Does that mean it tried a SQL injection and worked?</p>
<p>A: Perhaps.  It could also be a false positive.  You have to check in the database (in this case, ask your partner), if it went through.  However, this is something that you can document.</p>

<p class="directions">Q: If a tool doesn't give me back any alerts when spidering through something, does that mean that it hasn't found any, or that I don't know how to use the application?</p>
<p>A: If a tool doesn't return anything, it didn't find anything.  But any good security practitioner would know that you cannot depend on a (especially just one) scanning tool.</p>

<p class="directions">Q: I can't find any problems with my partner's application.  What should I do?</p>
<p>A: You can make security recommendations.  I will find it hard to believe that you cannot find problems.  Example: if you notice that your partner's web application uses the insecure methods, you can recommend to upgrade application to use more secure options.</p>

<p class="directions">Q: Is there a good example of a report?</p>
<p>A: See <a href="security-gjoseph/report.html">Gabe Joseph's report from last year</a>.</p>
